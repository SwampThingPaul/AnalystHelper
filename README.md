# AnalystHelper

A package of functions that I have accumulated through the years and have kept as `CommonlyUsedFunctions.R` on my harddrive and would use `source()` to utilize these functions. 

Using `library(roxygen2)` and R-studio "R-package Project" I constructed this package to be shareable amongst collaborators and generally be helpful in day-to-day analyses. Most of these functions are highly specific and constructed in my mind knowing what I knew at the time. Most functions presumably could be optimized. 

**Please excuse any grammatical/text errors**
